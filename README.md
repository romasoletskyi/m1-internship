# M1 internship
Code for my M1 internship "From Point to Interval Estimates of Scattering Statistics in the Component Separation Task" supervised by Erwan Allys. 

The repository is structured in the following way:
1. result.ipynb is an entry point, which contains metric calculations and generated denoised images for all six methods, which estimate mean and error bars for each statistic
2. macro.ipynb contains further details on macro-canonical denoising and Miyasawa denoising
3. folder core contains code which is used by methods run in notebooks
4. folder logs contains all generated images, which were used to calculate metrics
